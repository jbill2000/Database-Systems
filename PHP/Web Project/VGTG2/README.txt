Spencer:Attended Every Meeting, Wrote questions, Contributed to the pictures associated with the questions. 

Sara:   Contributed to Question writing by suggesting ideas. Did initial HTML, found our background, wrote the format HTML Code, Got the leaderboard working. Helped with a lot of logic. Worked with Jeremy to bounce ideas off of for PHP and attended every meeting. 

Jeremy: Contributed to Question writing by suggesting ideas. Did a majority of the PHP and communicating with the DB. However, that was of my own volition and not something that was forced on me by the group. I frequently got into the "zone" because I wanted to get the assignment done and took on a lot of the responsibility myself in that regard. None of the members asked me to do that and were more than willing to help with the majority of the php.
